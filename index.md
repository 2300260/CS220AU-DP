Today, data has become so big that it cannot be separated from our lives. Data is being generated at a very fast pace. Statista predicts that the amount of total data (the volume of data/information created, captured, copied, and consumed worldwide) will reach 64.2 zettabytes in 2020 and increase to over 180 zettabytes by 2025. One zettabyte is approximately one billion terabytes. So, it indicates a very large amount of data is generated. We access a wide range of data daily, such as viewing Instagram posts, posting photos or comments on social networking sites, communicating with others, and researching things we donâ€™t know about on websites. When we access data, we are also providing our own data to those websites and tech companies. In this blog post, I will explore what data tech companies collect and when and how they collect them. It also explores their intentions for collecting those data and then shows the impact they have on us in doing so (in this case, the beneficial impact and extensional risks they pose to us).

## The impact of tech companies on society
Tech companies have a wide range of impacts on the society that affect many aspects of our daily lives, including how we communicate with each other, work, daily life, and access information. Digital engagement by social media, streaming content, online shopping, and other activities has increased hundreds or even thousands of times over the past decade. (https://www.domo.com/data-never-sleeps#data) For example, in just one minute, 5.9M searches are made on Google, 66K photos are shared on Instagram, 231.4M messages are sent, $443K are spent for shopping on Amazon, and 500 hours of video are uploaded on YouTube. (Data Never Sleeps, https://www.domo.com/data-never-sleeps) The largest tech companies in the world are Facebook (Meta), Apple, and Google.
>More than 90% of the world uses Google search. google collects data on billions of consumers worldwide every day, with data on 72% of Google users in the US. (https://www.theregreview.org/2022/03/12/saturday-seminar-data-privacy-through-lens-big-tech/)

In this way, tech companies are collecting and tracking our data. Here is one question. **How much and what kind of data do these companies track?** We will explore this in the following text.

## Data collection;Why, when, and how
Recently, any web page that we visit will ask us to agree on essential cookies and privacy policy and need to choose whether we accept all cookies or not. By clicking 'Yes' or 'Agree' at the end of the privacy policy that appears when you open a web page, we allow companies to collect our data.


## Methods of data collection

## Digital identities

## The impact on individuals




## Explain about digital identities and extential risks
**Digital Identities**

**Extential Risks**

- How do they use our data?
- what is the purpose to correct them
- How and what kind of data do they track?(vpnMentor)
- Do existential risks differ depending on positioning(VR mapping)?

**what kind of Extential risks**
- privacy
- health
- cultural values
- could be bad effected to environment
